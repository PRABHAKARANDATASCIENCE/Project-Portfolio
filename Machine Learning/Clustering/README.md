#  Customer Segmentation Project Overview:

This project aims to segment customers of a mall based on their annual income and spending score. By utilizing various clustering techniques such as KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, distinct customer segments were identified to understand their behavior and preferences.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

- Explored the dataset to understand its structure, summary statistics, and correlations.
- Conducted both univariate and bivariate analyses to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between variables.
- Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
## Model Building and Evaluation:

- Built clustering models using KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms.
- Evaluated each model using metrics such as the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and dendrogram visualization to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Selected KMeans as the best-performing model for segmenting customers based on their spending habits and income levels.
## Insights and Segmentation:

- Identified distinct customer segments, including budget-conscious shoppers, potential investors, balanced spenders, splurge savers, and affluent aficionados, based on their spending behavior and income.
- Visualized the clustered data points along with centroids to understand the distribution of customer segments effectively.
# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering techniques in segmenting customers and understanding their preferences. By leveraging data-driven insights, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance overall satisfaction, leading to increased profitability and growth.
