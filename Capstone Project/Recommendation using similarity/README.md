# **Project Description:**
The goal of this project is to recommend similar products to users based on the input provided, which could be a product name, category, or description. The system leverages text embedding techniques to convert textual data into dense vectors in a semantic space, enabling meaningful comparisons between different pieces of text. Cosine similarity is then used to measure the similarity between the input query and the stored embeddings of products in the dataset. The top-N most similar products are retrieved and presented to the user as recommendations.

### Workflow Overview:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the textual data by removing punctuation and stopwords.
   - Combine relevant textual features like product names, categories, and descriptions into a single text field.

2. **Text Embedding**:
   - Utilize pre-trained sentence embedding models, such as MiniLM, to encode the combined textual data into dense vectors.
   - Each product's combined text is encoded into a fixed-size vector representation in a semantic space.

3. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Compute cosine similarity between the input query's embedding and the embeddings of all products in the dataset.
   - Retrieve the top-N most similar products based on their cosine similarity scores.

4. **Recommendation Display**:
   - Present the recommended similar products to the user, along with relevant details such as product name, category, and description.

### Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove noise from textual data by eliminating punctuation and stopwords.
- **Embedding Models**: Utilize pre-trained sentence embedding models provided by Hugging Face.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measure the similarity between vectors using cosine similarity metric.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to input keywords or product descriptions to retrieve similar products.
- **Recommendation Output**: Display the top-N similar products along with their details to the user.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Fine-tuning Models**: Fine-tune embedding models on domain-specific data to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback to refine recommendations over time.
- **Multimodal Data**: Extend the system to handle multimodal data, including images and user preferences.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the system for large-scale datasets to handle real-world applications.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide users with personalized and relevant product recommendations based on textual input, thereby enhancing their shopping experience and increasing engagement with the platform.
