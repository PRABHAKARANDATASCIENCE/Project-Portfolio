# **Introduction**
The project focuses on building a recommender system that suggests products to users based on their past ratings and preferences. It employs two main approaches: memory-based collaborative filtering and model-based collaborative filtering.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset containing user ratings for products (presumably from an e-commerce platform).
   - Select relevant columns such as `reviewerID`, `asin` (product ID), and `overall` (rating).

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Explore basic statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of ratings and user behavior.

3. **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Calculate the number of rated products per user to understand user engagement.
   - Compute the average rating for each product to identify popular products.
   - Visualize the distribution of average ratings for products.
   - Utilize the Surprise library to implement KNN-based collaborative filtering.
   - Train the model using the training set and evaluate its performance using the test set.
   - Print the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a measure of model accuracy.

4. **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Create a user-item matrix where rows represent users, columns represent products, and cells contain ratings.
   - Transpose the matrix to get an item-user matrix.
   - Decompose the item-user matrix using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to capture latent factors.
   - Compute the correlation matrix between products based on decomposed features.
   - Recommend top correlated products for a given product based on correlation threshold.
   - Merge recommended products with the original dataset to retrieve additional information such as product titles and ratings.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Display the top recommended products along with their titles and ratings to the user.

### Conclusion:
This project aims to provide personalized product recommendations to users by leveraging collaborative filtering techniques. It utilizes both memory-based and model-based approaches to analyze user-item interactions and identify patterns in the data. The final output is a list of recommended products tailored to each user's preferences, thereby enhancing their shopping experience and increasing user engagement.
