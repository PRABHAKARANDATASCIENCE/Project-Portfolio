# **Sentiment Analysis Project:**


**Introduction:**
- Brief overview of the project's objective: Analyzing customer sentiments from product reviews to understand consumer preferences and improve business strategies.
- Importance of sentiment analysis in today's business landscape.
- Introduction to the dataset: Meta data and reviews from the Office Products category.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
- Description of the dataset sources: Meta data and customer reviews from Amazon.
- Steps involved in data preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Data cleaning: Removing punctuation, stopwords, and lemmatization.
  - Feature engineering: Creating a new column for sentiment based on review ratings.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Overview of the dataset: Size, structure, and distribution of features.
- Visualizations:
  - Distribution of review ratings.
  - Proportion of verified and unverified reviews.
  - Distribution of sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
  - Bi-variant analysis: Relationship between review ratings and verification status.

**Modeling:**
- Description of the machine learning pipeline:
  - Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical format using TF-IDF.
  - Model selection: Testing multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
  - Model evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Discussion on handling imbalanced data using sampling techniques.
- Using one vs Rest classifier to pridect multiple prediction.
- Overview of the best performing model using Model evaluation.

**Model Deployment:**
- Saving the trained model using Pickle or Joblib for future use.
- Demonstration of how the model can predict sentiments on new, unseen review texts.

**Conclusion:**
- Recap of key findings and insights gained from the project.
- Importance of sentiment analysis in customer-centric businesses.
- Future enhancements and potential applications of the model.
